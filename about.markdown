I am a Research Fellow at Department of Physics, National University of Singapore. :slightly_smiling_face: I work on cutting edge projects in the field of computational materials science. My expertise and training is in density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory calculations at the level of GW-BSE (Bethe-Salpeter equtaion).
