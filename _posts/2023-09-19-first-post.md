To carry out DeltaSCF calculations, I find that not easy to converge the geometry
optimization in certain cases due to crossing of energy eigenvalues. Now I want to consider using
TDDFT to carry out the geometry optimizations, but I first need to understand 
whether it makes sense. I need to benchmark DeltaSCF and TDDFT for some system that
actually works to understand whether this is a workable solution. 

I am trying out some tests on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to see how much is necessary
to squash the negative frequencies.
